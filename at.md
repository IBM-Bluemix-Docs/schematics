## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} are automatically forwarded to your {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance. Because {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} sends events to the **US South** region only, you must create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} in the **US South** region to view event details. 
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a service instance of [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started) in the **US South** region. 
2. [Launch the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} web console](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2) to access your events.

## Analyzing events
