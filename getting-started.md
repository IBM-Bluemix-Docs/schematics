# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} and Terraform
{: #getting-started}

Enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}, and start provisioning templates, and manage {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment by using Terraform configuration files. 
{: shortdesc}

Check out the [lab and videos](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started){: external} to see how you can provision a VPC cluster with {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, and to learn more about Infrastructure as Code and Terraform.
{: tip}

## Create your Terraform template
{: #create-config}

Create a Terraform configuration file that specifies the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you want to provision with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}, and store the file in a GitHub repository to build your Terraform template. 
{: shortdesc}

In this getting started tutorial, you create a Terraform template with one Terraform configuration file that deploys a Gen 1 virtual server instance in a [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-started). 

When you follow the instructions in this tutorial, you store your Terraform template in GitHub to enable version control. {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} also lets you upload a tape archive file (`.tar`) from your local machine to provide the Terraform template. To learn more about this feature, see the [`ibmcloud schematics workspace upload`](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-upload) command.
{: tip}

A virtual server instance in a VPC incurs costs. Be sure to review the available plans for [VPC virtual server instances ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc/provision/vs) before you proceed.
{: important}

**What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and what resources do I need?** </br> 
With a VPC, you can create your own space in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} so that you can run an isolated environment in the public cloud with custom network policies. To provision a Gen 1 virtual server in a VPC, you must set up the following infrastructure resources: 
- 1 VPC, in which you provision your VPC virtual server instance
- 1 security group and a rule for this security group to allow SSH connections to your virtual server instance
- 1 subnet to enable networking in your VPC
- 1 VPC virtual server instance 
- 1 floating IP address that you use to access your VPC virtual server instance over the public network

All VPC resources must be provisioned to the same VPC zone to function properly. 
{: note}

**What do I need to provision a virtual server in a VPC?**</br>
To create a virtual server instance in a VPC, make sure that you have the [required permissions](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to create and work with VPC infrastructure. 

To connect to your virtual server instance, you must have an SSH key. You set up the SSH key as part of this tutorial. 

This tutorial includes VPC commands that you can run to retrieve input values for your Terraform template. To run these commands, you must install the [VPC CLI plug-in](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup). 
{: tip}

**Where can I find an overview of other supported resources in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}?**</br>
{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} supports all resources that are defined by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform. To find a full list of supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider reference](/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-index-of-terraform-resources-and-data-sources).

To create a configuration file for your VPC resources: 

1. Make sure that you have the [required permissions](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to create and work with VPC infrastructure. 
2. [Generate an SSH key](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-ssh-keys). The SSH key is required to provision the VPC virtual server instance and you can use the SSH key to access your instance via SSH. After you created your SSH key, make sure to [upload this SSH key to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console) in the VPC zone and resource group where you want to create your VPC and virtual server instance. 
3. Create your Terraform configuration `vpc.tf` file that includes all of the VPC infrastructure resources that you need to successfully run a virtual server instance in a VPC. For more information about how to structure a Terraform configuration file, see [Creating a Terraform configuration](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-create-tf-config).

4. Store this configuration file in a GitHub repository and name it `vpc.tf` to build your Terraform template. 

## Setting up your workspace
{: #setup-workspace}

Create a workspace in {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} that points to the GitHub repository that hosts your Terraform template. 
{: shortdesc}

**Before you begin** 
- Make sure that you have a [Terraform template in a GitHub repository](#create-config) that you can use for your workspace.
- Make sure that you are [assigned the correct permissions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management to create the workspace and deploy resources. 

**To create a workspace**: 
1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} menu, select [**{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}**](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview){: external}. 
2. Click **Create a workspace**. 
3. Configure your workspace. 
   1. Decide where you want to create your workspace. The location determines where your {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} actions run and your workspace data is stored. You can choose between a geography, such as North America, or a metro city, such as Frankfurt or London. If you select a geography, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} determines the location based on availability. If you select a metro city, your workspace is created in this location. For more information about where your data is stored, see [Where is my information stored?](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-secure-data#pi-location). The location that you choose is independent from the region or regions where you want to provision your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. Note that the console does not support all available locations. To create the workspace in a different location, use the [CLI](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#schematics-workspace-new) or [API](/apidocs/schematics#create-a-workspace) instead.
   2. Enter a descriptive name for your workspace. The name can be up to 128 characters long and can include alphanumeric characters, spaces, dashes, and underscores. When you create a workspace for your own Terraform template, consider including the microservice component that you set up with your Terraform template and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment where you want to deploy your resources in your name. For more information about how to structure your workspaces, see [Designing your workspace structure](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-workspace-setup#structure-workspace).
   3. Optional: Enter tags for your workspace. You can use the tags later to find workspaces that are related to each other.
   4. Select the resource group where you want to create the workspace.
   5. Optional: Enter a description for your workspace.
   6. Click **Create** to create your workspace. Your workspace is created with a **Draft** state and the workspace **Settings** page opens.
4. Connect your workspace to the GitHub or GitLab source repository where your Terraform configuration files are stored.
   1. On the workspace **Settings** page, enter the link to your GitHub or GitLab repository. The link can point to the `master` branch, any other branch, or a subdirectory. 
      - Example for `master` branch: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo`
      - Example for other branches: `https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/tree/mybranch`
      - Example for subdirectory: `https://github.com/mnorg/myrepo/tree/mybranch/mysubdirectory`
   2. If you want to use a private GitHub repository, enter your personal access token. The personal access token is used to authenticate with your GitHub repository to access your Terraform template. For more information, see [Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
   3. Select the Terraform version that your Terraform configuration files are written in. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} supports Terraform version 0.11 and 0.12. 
   4. Click **Save template information**. {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} automatically downloads the configuration files, scans them for syntax errors, and retrieves any input variables.
   5. In the **Input variables** section, enter the name of the SSH key that you uploaded to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account and the name of the resource group where you want to create your resources. 
   6. Click **Save changes**. 

## Provision your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources
{: #provision-resources}

Use {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} to run the infrastructure code in your Terraform configuration files, and to provision your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. 
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, set up your workspace in [{{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}](#setup-workspace). 

**To provision your resources**: 

1. From the workspace **Settings** page, click **Generate plan** to create a Terraform execution plan. This action equals the `terraform plan` command. The **Activity** page opens.
2. Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform execution plan. The execution plan includes a summary of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that must be created, modified, or deleted to achieve the state that you described in your Terraform template. If you have syntax errors in your configuration files, you can review the error message in the log file. 
3. Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**. This action equals the `terraform apply` command. After you click the button, {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} starts provisioning, modifying, or deleting your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources based on what actions were identified in the execution plan. Depending on the type and number of resources that you want to provision, this process might take a few minutes, or even up to hours to complete. During this time, you cannot make changes to your workspace. 
4. Review the log file to ensure that no errors occurred during the provisioning, modification, or deletion process. 
5. From the menu, select **Resources** to find a summary of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that are available in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. Use the link to the resource dashboard to see more details about the individual resource.
